          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-dark-primary">Our Story</h2>
          <p class="text-dark-secondary mb-4">
            {siteConfig.name} began as a small local service, helping neighbours with slow PCs, broken laptops and
            the odd printer that refused to behave. Word spread, and before long we were looking after homes and
            small businesses across South London, Surrey and the surrounding areas.
          </p>
          <p class="text-dark-secondary mb-4">
            We kept hearing the same thing: people rely on their computers and phones every day, but feel stuck
            when something goes wrong. You shouldn't have to be a tech expert just to use your own devices.
            Our aim has always been to take the stress out of IT problems and give you straightforward, honest help.
          </p>
          <p class="text-dark-secondary">
            That approach hasn’t changed. We still offer the same mix of friendly faces, clear explanations and
            practical fixes, so you can get back to work, family or everyday life as quickly as possible.

          No call centres, no posting your devices away and hoping for the best. Book a visit and we’ll come to you –
          at home or in your office. Our technicians handle everything from laptop and desktop repairs to phone
          screen replacements, data recovery, networking and virus removal.

        <p class="text-dark-secondary mb-4">
          All our work is covered by our <strong class="text-dark-primary">no fix - no fee</strong> guarantee. 
          If we can't put it right, you don't pay us. Simple as that.
        </p>
        <p class="text-dark-secondary">
          We also know that not everyone loves talking about tech. If you’re interested, we’re happy to explain
          exactly what went wrong. If you’re not, we’ll keep it brief and make sure everything is working properly
          before we leave. Either way, you’re kept in the loop in plain, straightforward language.

          At {siteConfig.name} our pricing is fair and transparent. We agree costs up front, talk you through the
          options, and if a repair isn’t worth doing, we’ll say so. There are no hidden extras and no pressure to
          go ahead with work you don’t need.
        </p>
        <p class="text-dark-secondary">
          Whether it’s a quick screen swap or a more involved data recovery job, the aim is always the same:
          professional, specialist help at a price that makes sense for households and small businesses.
